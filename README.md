# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-Model
Demand prediction using Linear Regression

# Introduction:
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
Such a company wants to know the significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes based on the dataset gathered.

# Solution:
We build a linear regression model to predict the factors influencing the bike sharing demand.
